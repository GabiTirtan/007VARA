    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our GPS is a camera-based centralized system wich is able to detect the position of your car by detecting the position of the attached Aruco marker. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has 3 major components:\n",
    "- **client car** = a competition car with a Aruco marker attached to it\n",
    "\n",
    "- **node** = a RaspberryPi with a PiCamera attached to it, placed at a certain height that allows the surveilance of a certain region of the competition track\n",
    "\n",
    "- **server node** = a node to whom the client car and all the other nodes are connected. It collects and processes all the data from the other nodes. It brodcasts 2 messages at a certain rate: that it is the server and the ID, position and orientation of your Aruco Marker.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of th eabove components have to be connected to the same network. To access the information provided by the system, you will have to authenticate from `your car` to the `server node`. The server node can change at every moment, being able to be replaced by any other node wich will become the new server. The server combines all the coordinate systems of the nodes in one unified coordinate system and computes the exact position of your car. \n",
    "\n",
    "The messages from the server are transmitted as follow:\n",
    "    - the 'I am the server' message is broadcasted on the `NEGOTIATION_PORT` by the server to all the devices connected to the network via the UDP protocol\n",
    "    - the message with the ID, position and orientation will be transmitted to your car \n",
    "\n",
    "###  How are the position and orientation computed?\n",
    "\n",
    " - **position** is denoted by the bottom left of your Aruco marker. The position will be transmitted in the global coordinate system\n",
    "\n",
    " - **orientation** is a vector specified by the bottom-corners of the Aruco marker. The orientation vector is perpendicular to the right side of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/gps2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical specification:\n",
    "- **accuracy:** 5-10cm\n",
    "- **position transmission rate:** 1 Hz\n",
    "- **server IP tasnsmission rate:** 0.52 Hz (once every 1.9 seconds)\n",
