Hey:)
Livestream:
1. copy the file client.py to the raspberry
2. get the file server.py on a computer connected to the same network as the raspberry and run it
3. run client.py on the raspberry(if there are import error, install using pip picamera[arrays] or any other imports that failed)
Now there should be a live feed of the camera on the computer runnig the server
