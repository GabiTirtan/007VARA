## <a name="use">How to use it</a>

These SW modules are given as examples and support materials for completing the
tasks required for the BOSCH Future Mobility Challenge.

## <a name="build">How to build</a>

You can build the SW for the micro-controller by using the GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm ([download link](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)) and GNU Make. You need to set in the MakeFile the correct location of the cross-compiler (GNU Compiler). You have to modify the first parameter in the commands 'AS','CC','CPP','LD','ELF2BIN' (lines 237-241).
